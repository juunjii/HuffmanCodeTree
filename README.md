# HuffmanCodeTree

## Overview 
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. 

## Concepts of Encoding 

### 1. Fixed Length Encoding 

Encoding text files in a computer may be an every-day task, but it was originally a difficult challenge
– one to which many different solutions exist. Normal approaches to encoding text files use what
are known as “fixed-length” encoding. This means that each letter corresponds to a fixed number
(say 8, or 16) of bits (zeros/ones) in the file. Each 8/16 bit pattern uniquely identifies one single
letter. A selection of standard fix-length codes under the ASCII coding scheme can be seen in the
table below:
